  AddGenieEventsToArt_module.cc - a module that allows one to import GENIE
      events in its native file format (gntp*.ghep.root) into art records
      with possible pile up, time offsets, and vertex smearing, and other
      features
  AddGenieEventsToArt.fcl - defines base FHiCL values
  addgeniejob.fcl - an actual example art job fcl to exercise the module

  GenieOutput_module.cc - a module that can extract MCTruth objects (and
      associated friends like MCFlux) and write them out as standard GENIE
      native event format (gntp*.ghep.root).  This module can also print
      those events in GENIE native format which is well structured.
  GenieOutput.fcl - defines base FHiCL values
  dump_genie_job.fcl - an actual example art job fcl to exercise the module

  TestGENIEHelper_module.cc - an experiment independent means of running
      GENIEHelper to generate interactions, but without ties to various
      experiment level data products for POT accounting.
  TestGENIEHelper.fcl - defines base FHiCL values
  runGENIEHelperTest.fcl - an actual example art job fcl to exercise the module


Potential CI test of GENIEHelper:

# need some version of the splines
setup genie_xsec v3_00_04a -q G1802a00000:e1000:k250
art -c runGENIEHelperTest.fcl -n 10

this is experiment independent but does rely on access to CVMFS for flux files.
